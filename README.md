A command interpreter, often referred to as a shell in Unix/Linux systems or Command Prompt in Windows, is a program that interprets and executes commands entered by users. It provides an interface for users to interact with an operating system by typing commands in a command-line environment.

Starting a Command Interpreter:
Unix/Linux (Bash Shell):

Terminal: To start a command interpreter, open a terminal application (like Terminal in macOS or various terminal emulators in Linux distributions).
Commands: Type bash or simply open the terminal to start the default shell.
Windows (Command Prompt):

Start Menu: Click on the Start button, then search for "Command Prompt" or "cmd" and select it to open the Command Prompt.
Run Command: Alternatively, press Win + R to open the Run dialog, then type cmd and hit Enter to open Command Prompt.
Using a Command Interpreter (Examples):
Once you've opened the command interpreter, you can start typing commands. Here are a few basic examples:

Common Commands:
List Directory Contents:

Unix/Linux: ls (list files and directories)
Windows: dir (display a list of files and directories)

Unix/Linux/Windows: cd directory_name (change the current directory to the specified directory)
Make Directory:

Unix/Linux/Windows: mkdir directory_name (create a new directory)
Copy Files:
